Build an ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant
AI expert Hadelin de Ponteves guides you through a case study that shows you how to build an ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.

The objective is to create a data model that predicts the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant using available hourly average ambient variables.

Go hands-on with Hadelin in solving this complex, real-world Deep Learning challenge that covers everything from data preprocessing to building and training an ANN, while utilizing the Machine Learning library, Tensorflow 2.0, and Google Colab, the free, browser-based notebook environment that runs completely in the cloud. Itâ€™s a game-changing interface that will supercharge your Machine Learning toolkit.
